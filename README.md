### Dependencies

`mantle` depends on 3 modules:
- [terra-money/core](https://github.com/terra-money/core): official terra network repository.
- [terra-money/mantle-sdk](https://github.com/terra-money/mantle-sdk): official `mantle-sdk`.

Versions of these packages need to adjusted in `go.mod` file to match the version of the network you are trying to index.

> The `go.mod` file in `master` branch is set to run with the latest mainnet.

### Adjusting package versions

> Unlisted networks are to be supported in the future.

#### terra-money/core

`core` version **MUST** match with the network version you're trying to index. Fix core's version in `go.mod` file accordingly.

- columbus-4: github.com/terra-money/core v0.4.0
- tequila-4: github.com/terra-money/core v0.4.0-rc.5

#### terra-money/compatibility
